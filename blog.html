                        The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
                        Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
                        Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be
                        accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
                        Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have
                        scope
                        to the immediate enclosing block.
                        <br>
                        If I don't need to reassign, `const` is my default choice over `let` because I want the usage to
                        be
                        as clear as possible in the code. I use `let` when I need to reassign a variable. Because I use
                        one
                        variable to represent one thing, the use case for `let` tends to be for loops or mathematical
                        algorithms.

                        Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and
                        callable.
                        Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However,
                        the
                        arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used
                        as
                        constructor functions.Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature
                        introduced
                        in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular
                        JavaScript
                        functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between
                        them.
                        <br>
                        Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are ‘constructible’ and
                        ‘callable’. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the ‘new’
                        keyword.
                        However, the arrow functions are only ‘callable’ and not constructible. Thus, we will get a
                        run-time
                        error on trying to construct a non-constructible arrow functions using the new keyword.

                        <strong>Why forEach? Ease of Use and Readability.</strong>
                        To me, the most compelling case for using .forEach() in favor of a for loop is that it’s easier.
                        Even though it’s the same number of lines, there’s less setup. With a regular for loop you have
                        three steps:

                        Define an iterator value: var i = 0;
                        Define an end point: i < array.length; Tell how the loop how should iterate: i++; With
                            .forEach() you simply pass a function that is executed on each element in the array. <br>
                            <strong> When to use forEach?</strong>
                            .forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each individual element in an array.
                            Good
                            practice is that you should use .forEach() when you can’t use other array methods to
                            accomplish
                            your goal. I know this may sound vague, but .forEach() is a generic tool… only use it when
                            you
                            can’t use a more specialized tool.
                            <br>
                            <strong> When to use map?</strong>
                            .map() when you want to transform elements in an array.
                            <br>
                            <strong>When to use filter?</strong>
                            .filter() when you want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array.
                            <br>
                            <strong> When to use find?</strong>
                            .find() When you want to select a single element from an array.
